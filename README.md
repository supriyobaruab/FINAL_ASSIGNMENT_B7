# Final assingment 
### Questions are as follows:
- Write a C++ program that takes marks of 6 different courses of a scholar as input and stores them into an integer type array. Input must be taken from the user. Check the number’s validity. The program takes only 0 to 100 as input. From that array find out the total percentage of the marks and finally check whether the total percentage is odd or even as well as Prime number or not. 
- Create a C++ program to manage staff salaries for a farm. Define a struct named Staff, which includes the attributes- stfID and monthlyWages. Implement methods within the struct-setData to set the staff information, displayData to display the staff details. Additionally, include an operational method called yearlyWagesWithBonus() to calculate the yearly wages with bonuses for each staff. The company provides two bonuses per year, each equal to 50 percent of the monthly wages. In the main function, demonstrate the usage of the Staff struct by creating an instance named s1, setting details, displaying the product information, and showing the yearly wages of this staff with 2 bonuses. 
- Design a C++ class named Parallelogram to represent a parallelogram's properties and calculate its area. The Parallelogram class should have some attributes. The Parallelogram class should also have the following member functions: 
setData1(): A setter function that sets the value. 
setData2 (): A setter function that sets the value. 
getData1(): A getter function that returns the value. 
getData2 (): A getter function that returns the value. 
getArea(): A getter function that returns the value of the parallelogram Area. 
display (): A function that shows the area of the parallelogram. 
- Now, write a C++ program that demonstrates how to create two objects of Parallelogram class using default and parameterized constructors, set parallelogram information, and access it using the getter functions. Finally calculate and then show the parallelogram area. 
Create a C++ program to manage students grades for a university. Define a struct named Students, which includes the attributes- stdID, name, department and semesterGrade. Implement methods within the struct-setInfo to set the staff information, displayInfo to display the details of students. Additionally, include an operational methods called  SGPA() and CGPA() to calculate the Grade Points with waivers for each student. The university provides waiver on good result. In the main function, demonstrate the usage of the Student struct by creating an instance named std1 std2 to set details, displaying information, and showing the semester-wise SGPA and CGPA after 4 years. 
- Design a C++ class named Customer to represent a Customer’s initial balance and calculate its balance with interest. The Customer class should have some attributes and it should also have the following member functions: 
setInitialBalance(): A setter function that sets the value of Initial Balance. 
getInitialBalance (): A setter function that sets the value of the Initial Balance. 
getInterest(): A getter function that returns the value of the interest. 
setInterest(): A getter function that returns the value of the interest. 
getYearEndBalance(): A getter function that returns the value of the yearend balance. 
display (): A function that shows the resultant output. 
Now, write a C++ program that demonstrates how to create two objects of Customer class using default and parameterized constructors, set parallelogram information, and access it using the getter functions. Finally calculate and then show the yearend balance.
